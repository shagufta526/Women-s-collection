Welcome to our e-commerce website for women's fashion, built using popular frontend web tools like HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. Our repository on GitHub provides a comprehensive overview of the source code used to build this static online store, as well as detailed documentation to help you understand how everything works.

Our website features a clean and modern design that showcases our vast selection of clothing, accessories, and beauty products for women. With an intuitive user interface and seamless navigation, our customers can easily browse and purchase items from their favorite brands.

Using HTML and CSS, we have crafted visually appealing and responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and devices. We have also leveraged the power of Bootstrap to incorporate advanced features like carousel sliders, modals into our website.
